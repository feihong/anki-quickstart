The general equation of a {{c1::circle}} is {{c2::\((x – h)^2 + (y – k)^2 = r^2\)}}, where  \((h,k)\) represents {{c3::the center}} and \(r\)  represents the {{c3::radius}}
(Inline) The formula for the {{c1::Pythagorean theorem}} is {{c2::\(c^2=a^2+b^2\)}}, where \(c\) represents the {{c1::hypotenuse}}
