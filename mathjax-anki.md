## MathJax examples

These examples use the Anki delimiters for MathJax, instead of the delimiters accepted by Markdown. Note that you must double the `\` symbol if you want it to appear in the HTML output.

This is inline MathJax: \\(\sqrt{x}\\). This is a MathJax block:

\\[{\sum}_{i = 1}^{n} {i}^{3} = {\left(\frac{n \left(n + 1\right)}{2}\right)}^{2}\\]
